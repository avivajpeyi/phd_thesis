I, the student, working within the School of Physics and Astronomy under the supervision of Dr Rory Smith and Professor Eric Thrane, played a majority role in contributing to the papers constituting Chapters~\ref{ch.bcr}-\ref{ch.tess}. My contributions to the papers presented in Chapters 2â€“7 are the following:
