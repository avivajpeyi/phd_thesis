\textbf{Preamble}

This chapter was originally published as:

\bibentry{pbilby}.

This chapter describes \textsc{Parallel Bilby}, or \textsc{pBilby}, an opensource, parallelised implementation of \textsc{Bilby}~\cite{bilby_paper, pbilby}~\footnote{Source code available on gitlab: \url{https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/parallel_bilby}.}. 
\textsc{pBilby} uses the Message Passing Interface \cite{mpi} to distribute samplers from \textsc{dynesty} (a nested sampling package, \cite{dynesty_paper}) over $n$-compute cores for analysis of compact-binary coalescence gravitational wave data.

Although I was not the primary author of this paper, I have played a major role in the development and maintenance of the software package \textsc{Parallal Bilby} described in this manuscript. 
Additionally, I have been leading the review of this software for the LVK.
