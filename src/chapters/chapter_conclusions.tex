\chapter{Summary and Conclusions}
\label{cp.conc}
In this thesis, I have XX.
I first provided a thorough overview of computational Bayesian analysis for gravitational-wave inference, introducing the software libraries underlying the bulk of the analysis in this thesis.
I then demonstrated GW151226...
These results tell us about astrophysics

In the last chapter of this thesis, I have illustrated a proof-of-concept design for the kind of science that may be facilitated by gravitational waves in the future, when conclusive measurements of mass and spin, and eccentricity will identify the AGN mergers in the population...

In the remainder of this thesis, I conclude with some thoughts about how this work should be improved and extended in the coming years.

\section{Infereing parameters of }

TESS, BCR, Pbilby, Deep Followup tell us about systems

\section{Population}
TESS AGN will tell us about populations
